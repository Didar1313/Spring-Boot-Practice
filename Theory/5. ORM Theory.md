## ‚úÖ What is ORM?

**ORM** stands for **Object-Relational Mapping**.

### üí° In simple terms:

> ORM is a **translator** that helps **Java objects** talk to a **relational database** (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2) **without writing SQL manually**.

---

### üß† Real-life analogy:

Imagine you‚Äôre using a food delivery app.

- You speak **English** (Java objects).
- The restaurant only understands **Chinese** (SQL database).
- So the app (ORM) **translates your English** order into **Chinese**, sends it to the restaurant, and gives you the food back in English.

That‚Äôs exactly what ORM does:  
‚û°Ô∏è It translates your **Java class and objects** into **SQL** behind the scenes.

## ‚úÖ Why do we use ORM in Spring Boot?

Without ORM:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 25);
```

With ORM:

```java
User user = new User(1, "John", 25);
userRepository.save(user); // ORM saves it to the DB for you!
```

ORM lets you **work with objects**, not SQL.

## ‚úÖ How Spring Boot handles ORM

Spring Boot uses **JPA (Java Persistence API)** as the interface and **Hibernate** as the default ORM tool.

### Here's how it works:

| Layer              | What you write/do                                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Model (`@Entity`)  | Your Java class like `User`                         |
| Repository         | Interface like `UserRepository` (extends JpaRepository) |
| JPA + Hibernate    | Translates Java objects into SQL queries            |
| Database           | Your actual MySQL/H2/Postgres DB                    |

---

### üß© Example:

#### 1. Your Model:
```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

#### 2. Your Repository:
```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Integer> {}
```

#### 3. Saving to DB:
```java
User user = new User(1, "Alice", 30);
userRepo.save(user); // ORM translates this into an INSERT query
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits of ORM

| Feature             | Benefit                                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| No SQL manually     | Less chance of errors and easier to write              |
| Auto table mapping  | Java class = table, field = column                     |
| Built-in queries    | Find by ID, name, age, etc. are already implemented    |
| Easy data handling  | Just use objects instead of writing SQL everywhere     |

---

## üîÑ Behind the scenes:

When you run `userRepo.save(user)`:
```sql
INSERT INTO user (id, name, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
```
Hibernate (ORM tool) creates and runs this SQL for you.
