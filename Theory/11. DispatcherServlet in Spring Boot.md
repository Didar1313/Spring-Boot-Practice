### üîπ What is `DispatcherServlet` in Spring Boot?

In Spring (and Spring Boot), the **`DispatcherServlet`** is the **central controller** that receives all HTTP requests and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers (like controllers or REST endpoints).

It's part of the **Spring MVC architecture** and acts as the **front controller** in the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern.

### üîÅ Flow of Request Handling (Simplified)

1. **Client** sends a request (e.g., `/users`).
2. **`DispatcherServlet`** receives it.
3. It looks for the right **controller method** using the URL and HTTP method.
4. Passes the request to that controller.
5. Controller returns data (or view).
6. `DispatcherServlet` sends back the response to the client.

### üß† Think of it like this:

> "`DispatcherServlet` is the **traffic police** of your Spring app. It receives every request and decides where it should go."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Where is it defined?

In Spring Boot, you **don‚Äôt need to manually configure** the `DispatcherServlet`. Spring Boot **automatically registers** it and maps it to handle requests at `/`.

### ‚úÖ Key Roles of `DispatcherServlet`:

| Role                   | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Front Controller**   | Handles all incoming HTTP requests.                                  |
| **Handler Mapping**    | Finds the right controller method for the request.                   |
| **View Resolver**      | If using Thymeleaf or JSP, it resolves and renders the correct view. |
| **Exception Handling** | Can route to error handlers if exceptions occur.                     |

---

### üìå Summary:

* `DispatcherServlet` is the **core component of Spring MVC**.
* It acts like a **router/controller manager**.
* In Spring Boot, it's **auto-configured**, so you don't need to set it up manually unless you want to customize behavior.
