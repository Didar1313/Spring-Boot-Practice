In **C programming**, when you run a program, it starts from `main()` and executes **line by line**, exactly how you wrote it.

In **Spring Boot**, things feel different because it‚Äôs based on **Java + Spring Framework**, and **Spring** uses a lot of **automation** and **background work** (like dependency injection, auto-configuration, etc.).  
**But still**, under the hood, **Spring Boot also runs step-by-step**, just like C.  
**The difference is:**  
Spring Boot does **a lot of things automatically for you**, so you don't have to write each step manually.

Let's see **how Spring Boot executes** in **simple steps**:

### 1. The program starts from `main()` method
Example:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
‚û°Ô∏è **It starts exactly from the `main()` function**, like C.  
Here, `SpringApplication.run()` is a **special Spring function**.

---

### 2. `SpringApplication.run()` does the real magic
When you call `SpringApplication.run()`, it:

- **Creates a Spring Container** (called ApplicationContext) ‚û°Ô∏è like creating a "big box" to manage your project
- **Scans your project** to find:
  - Classes with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, etc.
  - Beans and other configurations
- **Creates objects (beans)** and **connects** them together automatically (this is called **Dependency Injection**)
- **Starts** a web server (like Tomcat) if it‚Äôs a web app
- **Keeps your application running** and waiting for user requests (HTTP requests)

---

### 3. Then, it waits for something to happen
- If it‚Äôs a web app: It waits for the user to open a URL (browser request).
- If it‚Äôs a background job: It starts doing the work automatically.

---

### 4. When a request comes (like from a browser)
- Spring finds the right **Controller** class and method.
- It **calls the method**, gives it data if needed (like URL parameters, form data).
- Executes your code line by line.
- Sends back the result (HTML, JSON, etc.) to the browser.

### **Simple Real-life Example**

Think about it like this:  
‚úÖ C Program = **You cook everything by yourself.**  
‚úÖ Spring Boot App = **You have a lot of kitchen helpers.**  
You just say "I want a pizza" (calling `SpringApplication.run()`), and your helpers (Spring) know how to:
- Buy ingredients
- Prepare the dough
- Cook the pizza
- Serve it on a plate

You didn‚Äôt write each step by hand ‚Äî but step-by-step it still happens in order!

---

### **Super Simple Visualization**

```
main() ‚û°Ô∏è run SpringApplication ‚û°Ô∏è Create Container ‚û°Ô∏è Scan Classes ‚û°Ô∏è Create Beans ‚û°Ô∏è Set Connections ‚û°Ô∏è Start Web Server ‚û°Ô∏è Wait for Requests ‚û°Ô∏è Handle Requests ‚û°Ô∏è Return Response
```

---

### üî• In short:
- **Spring Boot does execute line by line**, but inside its own "helper" code.
- Your `main()` triggers a **huge engine** (Spring) that **manages all the steps** for you.
