# Singleton Pattern in Java

## What is a Singleton?

The Singleton is a **creational design pattern**. It ensures that **only one instance** of a class is created throughout the lifetime of the application. It also provides a **global point of access** to that single instance.

This pattern is used when exactly **one object is needed** to coordinate actions across the system, such as configuration managers, logging classes, or network managers.

## Why Use Singleton?

Here are some reasons to use the Singleton pattern:

- To **limit the instantiation** of a class to one object.
- To **control access** to shared resources (e.g., database connections, files).
- To maintain a **single state** of an object throughout the application.

## Pros of Singleton Pattern

✅ **Controlled access** to the sole instance
✅ Reduces **memory usage** if only one instance is ever needed
✅ Can be used to **share data** or configurations across multiple parts of an application

---

## Cons of Singleton Pattern

❌ Works like a **global variable**, which can lead to tightly coupled code
❌ Makes **unit testing harder** since it introduces a hidden dependency
❌ Can **violate the Single Responsibility Principle** if used for too many tasks

---

## Testing Limitations

Since a Singleton is a shared global object, it can be hard to test classes that depend on it. During unit testing, you often want to test components in isolation. But with a Singleton, you might unintentionally **carry over shared state** between tests unless properly reset.

---

## Alternatives

If you need a shared object but still want testability and flexibility, consider:

* **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Pass the instance to where it's needed.
* **Service Locators**
* **Factories** (if multiple instances are sometimes needed)

---

## Conclusion

Singleton is a powerful pattern for managing shared resources or controlling global state. But use it **carefully**. It's easy to overuse, which can make your code **hard to test and maintain**.
