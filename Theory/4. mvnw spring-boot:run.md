### 👉 `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

This command tells your terminal to **run your Spring Boot app using Maven**, but more specifically **using the Maven Wrapper**.



---

### 🧩 `./mvnw`

- This is the **Maven Wrapper script** that comes with your Spring Boot project.
- The `./` means: "run this file located in the current directory."
- `mvnw` is a script that downloads Maven automatically (if not installed) and ensures everyone on your team uses the **same Maven version**.

So even if you don’t have Maven globally installed, `./mvnw` makes it work!

On Mac/Linux: use `./mvnw`  
On Windows: use `mvnw.cmd`

### 🧩 `spring-boot:run`

- This tells Maven to **run your application** using the `spring-boot` plugin.
- It **compiles** your code, **builds it**, and then **runs the main class** (your `@SpringBootApplication`).

---

### ✅ So in plain English:

> “Hey terminal, use the Maven wrapper to run the Spring Boot app from the main class.”
