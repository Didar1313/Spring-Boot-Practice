## üìò What Is Logging in Spring Boot?

Logging is the process of writing messages from your application to help with:

* Debugging problems
* Monitoring behavior
* Understanding what's happening inside your app

Spring Boot comes **with built-in logging support**, so you don‚Äôt need to set anything up manually.

## ‚úÖ Default Logging System

Spring Boot uses:

### üîß **SLF4J + Logback** (by default)

* **SLF4J**: A common logging interface (like a remote control)
* **Logback**: The actual logger (like the TV receiving the signal)

> Spring Boot apps automatically use SLF4J + Logback unless you change it.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Write Logs in Code

Just add this to your class:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyService {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);

    public void doSomething() {
        logger.info("Service started...");
        logger.warn("This is a warning!");
        logger.error("Something went wrong!");
    }
}
```

> üîç `LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class)` creates a logger named after the class.

## ‚úÖ Default Log Levels in Spring Boot

Spring Boot supports these log levels (from most to least severe):

| Level   | Used for                         |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `ERROR` | Something failed badly           |
| `WARN`  | Something‚Äôs off, but app works   |
| `INFO`  | General app info (e.g., startup) |
| `DEBUG` | Extra details (used during dev)  |
| `TRACE` | Very detailed, rarely used       |

---


## ‚úÖ Changing Log Output Format

Set a custom pattern:

```properties
logging.pattern.console=%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
```
