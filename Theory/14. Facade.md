## 🧱 What is the Facade Pattern?

### 🔹 Simple Definition:

The **Facade Pattern** is a **design pattern** that gives you **one simple class** to use, instead of dealing with **many complicated classes** directly.

It hides the **complex stuff** behind the scenes, and gives you a **clean and easy-to-use interface**.

## 🧩 Type of Design Pattern?

> **📂 Category**: **Structural Design Pattern**
> (It helps you build a clean structure by organizing how classes work together.)

## 💡 Real-life Example:

Imagine you're in a **restaurant**:

* You don't talk to the **chef**, **manager**, and **cashier** separately.
* You talk to the **waiter** — and they handle everything for you.

In this example:

* The **waiter** is the **Facade**
* The **chef, manager, cashier** are complex subsystems

## 🛠 Why Use Facade in Spring Boot?

### 🎯 Goals:

* To **hide complex logic** from the controller
* To keep your **code clean and simple**
