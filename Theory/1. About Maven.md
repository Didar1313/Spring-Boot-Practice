**🌟 What Is Maven?**

---

### 🚀 Build Automation  
Maven streamlines your development workflow by handling:  
- **Compilation:** Transforms your Java source files into bytecode.  
- **Testing:** Executes your unit and integration tests.  
- **Packaging:** Bundles your app—often as a “fat” JAR in Spring Boot—with a single command.  
- **More:** From cleaning old builds to generating reports, Maven’s lifecycle phases have you covered.

### 📦 Dependency Management  
No more hunting down JAR files! Simply declare what you need, and Maven will:  
- **Resolve:** Fetch each library (and its dependencies) from central repositories.  
- **Version Control:** Ensure consistent versions across your team.  
- **Transitive Pulls:** Automatically include libraries your dependencies rely on.

### 🗂️ Project Convention  
Enjoy a **“convention-over-configuration”** approach with:  
1. **Standard Layout:**  
   ```
   my-app/
   ├─ pom.xml
   └─ src/
      ├─ main/java
      ├─ main/resources
      └─ test/java
   ```  
2. **Defined Lifecycle:** Predefined phases (compile, test, package, install, deploy) so every Maven project behaves predictably.  
3. **Ease of Onboarding:** Jump into any Maven-based project and instantly know where things live.
