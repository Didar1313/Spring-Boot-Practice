## ✅ What Does `@Service` Do?

### In short:

`@Service` is a **specialized annotation** used to mark a **service class** so that Spring can:

1. **Automatically detect it** during component scanning
2. **Register it as a Spring Bean**
3. **Enable dependency injection** where it's needed

```java
@Service
public class ProjectService {
    // business logic
}
```

## 🔍 What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When you annotate a class with `@Service`:

### 1. **Component Scanning**:

Spring scans packages for annotations like:

* `@Component`
* `@Service`
* `@Repository`
* `@Controller`

All of these are **stereotypes** of `@Component`, meaning they are picked up the same way.

> ✅ So `@Service` is essentially a `@Component`, but with **semantic meaning** — it tells **you and the framework** this class is for business logic.

### 2. **Bean Registration**:

Spring adds this class to its **ApplicationContext**, meaning:

* You don’t need to manually create or manage the object.
* You can inject it using `@Autowired`, constructor injection, etc.

```java
@Autowired
private ProjectService service;
```

or (better):

```java
public ProjectController(ProjectService service) {
    this.service = service;
}
```

### 3. **Enables AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**:

Spring may apply **additional behaviors** (like logging, transactions, security) around methods in `@Service` classes using **proxies**.

> For example, if you later add `@Transactional` to a method, Spring wraps it with transaction logic automatically.

## 🧠 Why Use `@Service` and Not Just `@Component`?

You *could* use `@Component` for everything, but using `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Repository` makes your code:

* 📚 Easier to read and maintain
* ✅ Semantically clear (what each class is for)
* 🎯 Automatically supports some **extra behaviors** (like transaction management in services or exception translation in repositories)

## 🏗️ Typical Layered Architecture with Spring Annotations

```
@Controller       --> Web/API Layer (e.g. ProjectController)
@Service          --> Business Logic Layer (e.g. ProjectService)
@Repository       --> Data Access Layer (e.g. ProjectRepository)
```

Each of these layers is wired and managed automatically by Spring, thanks to these annotations.

## ✅ Summary

| Annotation    | Purpose                          | Layer                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `@Component`  | Generic Spring-managed component | Any                  |
| `@Service`    | Marks business logic classes     | Service Layer        |
| `@Repository` | Data access + exception handling | Repository/DAO Layer |
| `@Controller` | Web layer (HTTP endpoints)       | Controller Layer     |
